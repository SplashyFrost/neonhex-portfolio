# NeonHex Portfolio

Hi! ğŸ‘‹  
This is my personal portfolio website, called **NeonHex**. I built it as a **young student** who is just starting to learn web development.  
Yes, I know it's not perfect â€” the design might be a bit messy, colors may look too bright, and some layout choices could be improved â€” but this is my first attempt at creating a **modern, neon-style portfolio**.
