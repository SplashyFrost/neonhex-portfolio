# neonhex-portfolio
NeonHex Portfolio is the personal website of a young student just starting with web development. It features a modern neon/cyberpunk dark theme, animated icons, and sections for skills, projects, and a contact form. Although still simple and a bit rough, it showcases the first experiments with layout, animations, and interactivity.
